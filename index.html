          </div>
          <p>
          Pong is a table tennis-themed arcade video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, 
          manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972. It was one of the earliest arcade video 
          games; it was created by Allan Alcorn as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder 
          Nolan Bushnell, but Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by the quality of 
          Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game. Bushnell based the game's concept on an 
          electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video game console. 
          In response, Magnavox later sued Atari for patent infringement.

            Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an 
            in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They 
            can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players 
            use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven 
            points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other
          </p>
          <h3>Development History</h3>
          <p>
            Pong was the first game developed by Atari.After producing Computer Space, Bushnell 
            decided to form a company to produce more games by licensing ideas to other companies. The 
            first contract was with Bally Manufacturing Corporation for a driving game. Soon after 
            the founding, Bushnell hired Allan Alcorn because of his experience with electrical engineering 
            and computer science; Bushnell and Dabney also had previously worked with him at Ampex. Prior 
            to working at Atari, Alcorn had no experience with video games. To acclimate Alcorn to creating 
            games, Bushnell gave him a project secretly meant to be a warm-up exercise. Bushnell told
             Alcorn that he had a contract with General Electric for a product, and asked Alcorn to create a 
             simple game with one moving spot, two paddles, and digits for score keeping.In 2011, Bushnell 
             stated that the game was inspired by previous versions of electronic tennis he had played before; 
             Bushnell played a version on a PDP-1 computer in 1964 while attending college. However, Alcorn has 
             claimed it was in direct response to Bushnell's viewing of the Magnavox Odyssey's Tennis game.
             In May 1972, Bushnell had visited the Magnavox Profit Caravan in Burlingame, California where he 
             played the Magnavox Odyssey demonstration, specifically the table tennis game. Though he 
             thought the game lacked quality, seeing it prompted Bushnell to assign the project to Alcorn.
